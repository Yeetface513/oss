## Blueberry OS
### The rewrite
- Taking bad code and turning into readable code

## Kept:
- boot code
- memory management code
- some of kernel.c
- libc/kernel
- libc/io
- some of Makefile

## Improved:
- typed is now a char * not a char **
- keyboard input streamlined, command writing made easier
- comments written
- file structure simplified
